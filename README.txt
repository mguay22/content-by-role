Content By Role allows for multiple redirects to be added to a restricted page based off of the user's role on the site.

== Description ==

This role restricting plugin is lightweight and simple to use. It allows for more than one redirect rule to be added to a page based off of a user's role.

I developed this plugin to make it easier to add multiple role based redirects to a single page. I am actively developing this plugin so if you have any questions, suggestions, or bugs to report - please do so in the Support section.
